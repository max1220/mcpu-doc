# MCPU - Documentation

This repository is the homepage for documentation regarding the MCPU
CPU instruction set architecture.



## About MCPU

The MCPU architecture is a CPU instruction set that was designed to be
easy to implement and understand.

There are also several example implementations to lear from, including a web
based emulator and assembler that you can try in your browser, as well as an
implementation in Minecraft.



## Getting started

The easiest way to learn more about MCPU is to go to the homepage of the
mcpu-web project: It features the MCPU documentation in HTML form, and also
has a built-in emulator and assembler and interactive examples.

The [quick reference](md/Quick_reference.md) is also very useful as a reference.
